# Build for hhm_rpp_siemens: deps only. Fleet paradigm
# (data_acquisition/docs/migration_CLAUDE.md Part 1), with one deliberate
# deviation: THIS APP BUILDS NO IMAGE. It runs ge's shared hhm_rpp image
# (see CLAUDE.md "KNOWN WARTS"), so this script:
#
#   1. Creates ./utils/logger/logs as the CALLING user. The gosu entrypoint is
#      baked into ge's image and does NO log-dir repair, so if Docker creates
#      the missing bind source it is root-owned and the first run dies EACCES
#      inside createWriteStream — before any logging exists to say why.
#   2. npm install at the project root, inside a throwaway node:lts container
#      as the calling host user, so node_modules lands IN-TREE with ownership
#      matching the host (no shared cache dir — each copy owns its deps).
#   3. Verifies the shared image hhm_rpp:${IMAGE_TAG} exists. If missing it
#      must be built in hhm_rpp_ge (the image owner) — never from here.
